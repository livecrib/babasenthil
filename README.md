Sorry for making this document awkward.

Activity_main.xml contains the xml code for basic UI. Please customize it. Our aim is to make the UI look best. Kindly use a scrollview or a container.
The existing xml code is only for 5 textboxes and do not contain designs.
Once the xml part is done, please add MainActivity under java file. I have mapped both the files.Only change the designs.
##NOTE: DO NOT MODIFY MainActivity.java FILE##

ALL THE BEST GUYZZZ...  CHEERS..
